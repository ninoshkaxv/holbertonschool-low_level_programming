# Memory Allocation and Program Termination

This document provides documentation for the `malloc`, 'calloc', 'realloc' and `exit` functions in C.

## `malloc` Function

The `malloc` function is used for dynamic memory allocation in C.

## How to Use the `exit` Function

The `exit` function in C is used to terminate a program's execution and return control to the operating system. It can be helpful for gracefully ending a program and performing cleanup tasks, such as freeing allocated memory or closing files.

## 'calloc' Function

The calloc function is used to dynamically allocate memory for an array of elements and initializes the memory to zero.

## 'realloc' Function

The realloc function is used to change the size of a previously allocated block of memory.
