# Function Pointers in C

## Overview

This document provides an introduction to function pointers in the C programming language, explaining what function pointers are. It also discusses the content held by a function pointer and where in the virtual memory a function pointer points to.

## Function Pointers

A function pointer in C is a variable that stores the memory address of a function. It enables indirect invocation of functions, providing flexibility in function calls.

### Content Held by Function Pointers

A function pointer exactly holds the memory address of a function. It points to the starting address of the machine code representing the function's implementation.

### Location in Virtual Memory

A function pointer points to the code section of the virtual memory where the corresponding function's executable code is loaded. This allows dynamic invocation of functions during runtime.
