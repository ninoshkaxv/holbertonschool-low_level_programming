# This document provides an overview of macros in C and C++ programming, including the use of macros, common predefined macros, and the importance of include guards in header files.

## Macros

### What Are Macros?

In C and C++ programming, macros are a way to define reusable code snippets or constants using the `#define` directive. They allow you to simplify code, enhance readability, and manage configuration options.

### How to Use Macros

You can define a macro using the `#define` directive, followed by the macro name and its value. Macros are typically written in uppercase to distinguish them from variables and functions.

## Predefined Macros

Predefined macros are constants automatically defined by the C and C++ compilers. They provide information about the compiler, platform, and build environment, which can be useful for conditional compilation and platform-specific code.
Some common predefined macros include:

    __FILE__: Name of the current source file.
    __LINE__: Current line number within the source file.
    __DATE__: Date when the source file was last modified.
    __TIME__: Time when the source file was last modified.
    __cplusplus: Defined when compiling C++ code.

## Include Guards

Include guards (or header guards) are used in header files to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header in a source file. They ensure that the content of a header file is included only once, avoiding redefinition errors and improving compilation efficiency.
