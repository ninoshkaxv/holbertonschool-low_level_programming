## Variadic Functions

### Definition

Variadic functions in C are functions that accept a variable number of arguments. These functions are defined with an ellipsis (...) in their parameter list, allowing them to receive a flexible number of arguments.

## Handling Variable Arguments

### va_start, va_arg, and va_end Macros

#### va_start

The `va_start` macro initializes a `va_list` object, which is used to traverse the variable arguments in a variadic function. It takes the `va_list` object and the last named parameter as arguments.

#### va_arg

The `va_arg` macro retrieves the next argument from the `va_list` and specifies the type of the argument. It takes the `va_list` object and the type of the argument as arguments.

#### va_end

The `va_end` macro performs cleanup after variable argument processing. It takes the `va_list` object as an argument and should be called before the function returns.

## Const Type Qualifier

### Definition

The `const` type qualifier in C is used to declare constants or to specify that a variable is read-only. When applied to a variable, it indicates that the variable's value cannot be modified after initialization.

### Purpose and Usage

Using the `const` qualifier has several benefits:

- **Readability:** It makes the code more readable by signaling the intent that a variable should not be modified.

- **Compiler Optimization:** It allows the compiler to optimize code better, knowing that certain variables won't change.

- **Preventing Bugs:** It helps prevent accidental modifications to variables, reducing the chance of bugs related to unintended changes.
